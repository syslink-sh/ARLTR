## About

ARLTR proves the ancient saying by finding real routes from anywhere in the world to Rome. Click any location on the map and watch as it calculates the best path to the Eternal City.

The app automatically determines whether to use land routes, sea routes, or a combination of both. Direct road connections appear as blue lines, while maritime routes show as red dashed lines with port stops.

## How It Works

Click anywhere on the world map. The app places a marker and calculates your route to Rome using real-world routing data. It handles everything from simple overland journeys to complex multi-modal trips involving ocean crossings.

## Customization

Want to create your own version? ARLTR is fully customizable through the `config.js` file. You can:

**Change the destination city** - Modify `DESTINATION.coords` and `DESTINATION.name` to route to any city  
**Update branding** - Change site title, footer text, and contact information  
**Customize colors** - Modify route colors, marker icons, and styling  
**Toggle features** - Enable/disable beta badge, feedback button, and other features  
**Adjust map settings** - Set default zoom levels and map boundaries  

Simply edit the values in `config.js` and your changes will automatically apply to the website.
