## About

ARLTR proves the ancient saying by finding real routes from anywhere in the world to Rome. Click any location on the map and watch as it calculates the best path to the Eternal City.

The app automatically determines whether to use land routes, sea routes, or a combination of both. Direct road connections appear as blue lines, while maritime routes show as red dashed lines with port stops.

## How It Works

Click anywhere on the world map. The app places a marker and calculates your route to Rome using real-world routing data. It handles everything from simple overland journeys to complex multi-modal trips involving ocean crossings.
