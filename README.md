## about

arltr just shows u a route to rome. click anywhere and it does its thing. land, sea, both… it picks whatever. blue lines for land, red dashed for sea. simple.

## how it works

click on the map, it drops a marker, calculates a route, done. handles boring overland stuff and random sea crossings automatically.

## customization

u can mess with everything in `config.js`:

* change destination coords + name
* change title, footer, whatever branding u want
* change colors and markers
* toggle features on/off
* adjust map zoom and boundaries

just edit the file. it updates. nothing fancy.
