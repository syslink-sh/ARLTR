## About

ARLTR is an interactive web application that puts the ancient saying "All roads lead to Rome" to the test. Whether you're clicking from the bustling streets of Tokyo, the remote islands of Polynesia, or the vast expanses of the Sahara Desert, our app will find a way to get you to the Eternal City.

This isn't just about proving a point – it's about exploring the incredible connectivity of our world and discovering the creative solutions required when traditional routes don't exist.

## What It Does

**Interactive Global Mapping** - Click anywhere on our world map to begin your journey  
**Intelligent Route Planning** - Automatically determines the best possible path to Rome  
**Multi-Modal Transportation** - Seamlessly combines land and sea routes when needed  
**Visual Route Differentiation** - Clear distinctions between different types of travel segments  
**Real-Time Route Calculation** - Uses current routing data for accurate pathfinding  
**Comprehensive Distance Metrics** - Detailed breakdown of your journey's length  

## How It Works

The process is refreshingly simple. Click any location on the map, and watch as ARLTR places a marker at your chosen starting point. The application then gets to work, analyzing possible routes and calculating the most practical path to Rome.

When direct land routes are available, you'll see clean blue lines tracing highways and roads across continents. But here's where it gets interesting – when you click somewhere truly remote, like a Pacific island or the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, ARLTR doesn't give up. Instead, it finds the nearest major port, creates a sea route to get you there, then continues with land-based travel to complete your journey to Rome.

## Route Types Explained

**Direct Land Routes** appear as solid blue lines when continuous road networks connect your starting point directly to Rome. These are your standard overland journeys.

**Combined Sea and Land Routes** kick in when your starting location requires ocean travel. Red dashed lines indicate maritime portions of your journey, while blue segments show the overland portions.

**Port Integration** automatically identifies major international ports and shipping hubs, displaying them as waypoints in your journey when sea travel is necessary.

**Distance Calculations** provide both individual segment distances and total journey length, giving you a complete picture of your theoretical trip to Rome.

## The Technology Behind It

ARLTR leverages modern web technologies and real-world routing APIs to deliver accurate, up-to-date travel information. The application responds instantly to user interactions while processing complex geographical calculations in the background.

## Current Status

This is a beta release, which means we're continuously refining the routing algorithms and adding new features based on user feedback. The core functionality is solid, but we're always working to make the experience even better.
